### [View The Documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)

kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".  
kind is primarily designed for testing Kubernetes 1.11+, initially targeting the [conformance tests].

If you have [go] and [docker] installed `GO111MODULE="on" go get -u sigs.k8s.io/kind@master && kind create cluster` is all you need!

<img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/BenTheElder/621bc321fc6d9506fd936feb36d32dd0/raw/13fe81c219e64b4917575c8988e06719c072c7f1/kind-demo.gif" alt="2x speed `kind create cluster` demo" />

kind consists of:
- Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
- A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
- Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

kind bootstraps each "node" with [kubeadm][kubeadm]. For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

**NOTE**: kind is still a work in progress, see the [1.0 roadmap].

## Installation and usage

You can install the latest bleeding edge kind code with `GO111MODULE="on" go get -u sigs.k8s.io/kind@master`.

**NOTE**: please use the latest go to do this, ideally go 1.12.5 or greater.

This will put `kind` in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If you encounter the error
`kind: command not found` after installation then you may need to either add that directory to your `$PATH` as
shown [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) or do manual installation by cloning the repo and run 
`make build` from the repository.

Without installing go, kind can be built reproducibly with docker using `make build`.

Stable binaries are also available on the [releases] page. Stable releases are
generally recommended for CI usage in particular.
To install, download the binary for your platform from "Assets" and place this
into your `$PATH`. E.G. for macOS:

```console
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/download/0.2.1/kind-darwin-amd64
chmod +x kind-darwin-amd64
mv kind-darwin-amd64 /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
```

To use kind, you will need to [install docker].  
Once you have docker running you can create a cluster with `kind create cluster`  
To delete your cluster use `kind delete cluster`

<!--TODO(bentheelder): improve this part of the guide-->
To create a cluster from Kubernetes source:
- ensure that Kubernetes is cloned in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`
- build a node image and create a cluster with `kind build node-image && kind create cluster --image kindest/node:latest`

Multi-node clusters and other advanced features may be configured with a config
file, for more usage see [the docs][user guide] or run `kind [command] --help`

## Why kind?

- kind supports multi-node (including HA) clusters
- kind supports building Kubernetes release builds from source
  - support for make / bash / docker, bazel, or installing from apt, in addition to pre-published builds.
